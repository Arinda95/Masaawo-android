<p>Masaawo is a free tool created by an individual to help prevent criminal attacks through the public transportation system by providing user submitted information to help users identify and avoid criminal transport vehicles. After a recent rise in vehicular robberies, many of which affected people close to me I sought to use my skills to mobilize the public to keep our transportation system safe and to provide tools for members of the general public to safeguard themselves</p>
