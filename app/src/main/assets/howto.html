<p>Reporting number plates.</p>
<p>Reporting number plates is unfortunately disabled in the mobile application for security reasons, you send the numberplate and all necessary information to www.masaawo5@gmail.com
or you can report a numberplate by going to www.masaawo.com, log in with your personal phone number and secure password (cannot be
changed so remember it) Then you can head to 'report a vehicle' and fill in the form.
You will be contacted to verify information.</p>
